    "\n",
    "#### Due Tuesday February 24 on Gradescope. Please see detailed submission instructions below.  120 points total.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to do this problem set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Python version 3.  We strongly suggest installing Python from the [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are on Windows, you will need to install a package to use Unix commands. We suggest [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download [`large_movie_review_dataset.zip`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YfrrJkwZXk8qJiq7PDD_UqJ3qWowA2Pu/view?usp=drive_link). and also `lotr_script.txt` (in this zip file). We will use these two datasets in this homework. The first dataset may take a long time to unzip. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of these questions require writing Python code or Unix commands and computing results, while the remainder have textual answers. To complete this assignment, you will need to fill out the supporting files, `hw1.py` and `hw1.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all of the textual answers, replace the placeholder text (\"Answer in one or two sentences here.\") with your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment is designed so that you can run all cells in a few minutes of computation time. If it is taking longer than that, you probably have a mistake in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to submit this problem set:\n",
    "- Write all the answers in this ipython notebook. Once you are finished, (1) Generate a PDF via (File -> Download As -> PDF)  (2) Upload your pdf file to Gradescope.  (3) Compress `hw1.py`, `hw1.sh`, and `hw1.ipynb` into one zip file and upload to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important:** Check your PDF before you turn it in to gradescope to make sure it exported correctly. If ipython notebook gets confused about your syntax it will sometimes terminate the PDF creation routine early. You are responsible for checking for these errors. If your whole PDF does not print, try running on the commandline `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf hw1.ipynb` to identify and fix any syntax errors that might be causing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important:** When creating your final version of the PDF to hand in, please do a fresh restart and execute every cell in order. Then you'll be sure it's actually right. One convenient way to do this is by clicking `Cell -> Run All` in the notebook menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are having trouble with PDF export, you can always paste screenshots into a word processor then turn that into PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Academic honesty:\n",
    "- Like always, check the course's collaboration policy -- see the syllabus (on Canvas): all of the content you submit, both code and text, needs to be produced independently; do not share code or written materials, and list anyone you worked with for discussions.  We will check code for plagiarism and we will follow up collaboration policy violations with the university’s Academic Honesty Policy and Procedures.\n",
